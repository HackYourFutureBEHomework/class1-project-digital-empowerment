# HackYourFutureBE Class 1 Project - Digital Empowerment

We're developing a real-world application for Hobo. Hobo is a day center for homeless people in Brussels. They would like to create a learning tool that teaches basic computer skills and tasks for the people coming to the center.

### Goals for the project
  - **Teach people without prior experience to use a computer for basic tasks**: this teaching will both be accompanied and unaccompanied. It’s important to have the least amount of text as possible present on the site, everything should be visual and interactive.
  - Allow Hobo to manage the application without developer interference: Application administrators at hobo should be able to manage the application’s contents and users easily and without having to consult a developer. 

### Goals for the students
  - Learn to understand an existing codebase in a short period of time
  - Get experience working on existing projects
  - Get experience working on open-source projects
  - Get familiar with the basics of project management with agile
  - Become comfortable with reporting about your work and communicating within a team
 
You will also receive some CV and LinkedIn training to get ready for the Belgian job market.
