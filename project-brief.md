# Hobo Project Analysis

## Overview
Hobo is a day center for homeless people in Brussels. They would like to have a learning tool that teaches basic computer skills and tasks.
The end result will be a web application where:
  - People from Hobo vzw can create and delete learning paths and add modules to it in a specific order. They can add, update and delete module contents in an Explanation - Exercise - Evaluation format. They can also manage the tool‚Äôs active users.
  - Learners can pick learning paths and follow modules in any given order. They should be able to use the tool semi-autonomously, mostly requiring help for exercise evaluation.
